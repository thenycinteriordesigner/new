  { question: "How accurate is this cost estimator?", answer: "This tool provides a ballpark range based on typical NYC interior design costs. Actual pricing depends on room complexity, material selections, existing conditions, and project-specific details. For an accurate quote, request a free consultation — we will assess your space and provide a detailed written proposal." },
  { question: "Why is interior design in NYC more expensive than other areas?", answer: "NYC interior design costs are higher due to: limited building access (freight elevators, delivery windows), higher labor costs, co-op/condo board requirements, DOB permit fees, building insurance requirements, and the complexity of working in pre-war and high-rise buildings. Building logistics alone can add 15-30% to costs." },
  { question: "What factors affect interior design cost the most?", answer: "The biggest cost drivers are: (1) room type and scope (kitchen/bathroom renovations cost more than living room refreshes), (2) material and finish selections (custom vs. stock), (3) whether structural or plumbing changes are involved, (4) co-op/condo board requirements, and (5) borough — Manhattan projects typically cost 15-25% more than outer boroughs." },
  { question: "Does the estimate include design fees?", answer: "Design fees are typically separate from materials and installation. Our design fees range from $150-$350/hour or 15-25% of the total project budget, depending on scope. For projects over $25,000, design fees are often included in the overall project cost." },
  { question: "How much does a typical NYC apartment renovation cost?", answer: "A cosmetic refresh (paint, lighting, furniture) runs $15,000-$50,000. A moderate renovation (kitchen, bathroom, some layout changes) runs $75,000-$200,000. A gut renovation of a 2-bedroom apartment typically runs $200,000-$500,000+. Luxury gut renovations in Manhattan can exceed $1M." },
  { question: "Do you offer payment plans?", answer: "We offer phased payment schedules for projects over $25,000. Typical terms: 30% design deposit, 40% at material procurement, 30% on completion. For larger projects, we can arrange customized payment schedules. We accept all major credit cards, checks, and wire transfers." },
