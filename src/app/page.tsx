const homeFAQs = [
  { question: "What interior design services do you offer in NYC?", answer: "We offer comprehensive interior design services including full-home design, kitchen design, bathroom design, space planning, color consultation, furniture selection, lighting design, renovation management, staging, custom closets, and more. We serve all five boroughs, Long Island, Westchester, and New Jersey." },
  { question: "Do you work in all five boroughs?", answer: "Yes. We provide full-service interior design across Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx, and Staten Island, as well as Long Island, Westchester County, and New Jersey. Each area has unique design challenges and we tailor our approach accordingly." },
  { question: "How much does interior design cost in NYC?", answer: "Interior design costs in NYC vary based on project scope, property size, and material selections. A single-room design starts around $2,500, while a full-home design ranges from $15,000 to $50,000+. Kitchen and bathroom renovations typically range from $25,000 to $100,000+. Contact us for a free consultation tailored to your project." },
  { question: "Do you offer free consultations?", answer: "Yes. We provide free initial consultations for all interior design projects in our service area. One of our design professionals will visit your property, discuss your vision, and provide a detailed proposal with no obligation." },
  { question: "What is the best time to start an interior design project in NYC?", answer: "Any time is a good time to start planning. However, spring and fall are popular for renovations due to milder weather for deliveries and construction. Winter is ideal for planning and design work so you're ready to begin construction in spring. Lead times for custom furniture and materials can be 8-16 weeks, so starting early is always smart." },
  { question: "Do you handle NYC permits and co-op board approvals?", answer: "Yes. Many interior renovation projects in NYC require permits from the Department of Buildings (DOB), especially those involving plumbing, electrical, or structural changes. We handle all permit applications and coordinate with co-op and condo boards on alteration agreements on your behalf." },
