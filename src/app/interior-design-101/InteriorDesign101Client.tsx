                    Interior design in New York City is fundamentally different from interior design anywhere else. <strong>Space is limited, building rules are strict, access is complicated, and the cost of everything is higher</strong> — but the results can be extraordinary.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A well-designed NYC interior is not just about aesthetics — it dramatically increases property value, improves daily quality of life, and creates a personal sanctuary in the most densely populated city in America. Whether you are working with a 500 sq ft studio in Murray Hill or a 3,000 sq ft brownstone in Park Slope, thoughtful design transforms how you live.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    NYC interior design encompasses <strong>space planning</strong> (making every square foot count), <strong>material selection</strong> (finishes, flooring, cabinetry), <strong>furniture procurement</strong> (trade showrooms and custom pieces), <strong>lighting design</strong> (layered, functional, atmospheric), <strong>color consultation</strong>, and <strong>renovation management</strong> (permits, contractors, building logistics).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Key factors that make NYC design unique: limited natural light in many apartments due to neighboring buildings, strict co-op and condo board requirements for renovations, restricted freight elevator access for deliveries, pre-war building quirks (uneven floors, plaster walls, limited electrical), and four distinct seasons that affect material choices.
                  </p>
                  <Tip>Before starting any project, understand three things: (1) your building&apos;s rules and restrictions, (2) your budget including a 15-20% contingency, and (3) your realistic timeline. These three factors drive every design decision in NYC.</Tip>

                  <p>
                    Every great interior design project starts with deeply understanding the space you have. In NYC, this means more than just measuring rooms — it means understanding how light moves through your apartment throughout the day, how traffic flows between rooms, where storage is needed most, and how the space actually gets used.
                  </p>

                      <p><strong>Natural Light:</strong> Track how sunlight enters each room at different times of day. North-facing rooms get cool, consistent light. South-facing rooms get warm, bright light. This affects paint colors, fabric choices, and furniture placement.</p>
                      <p><strong>Traffic Flow:</strong> Map how you move through your home. Identify bottlenecks, wasted space, and areas that could serve multiple functions. In NYC, circulation paths are often the biggest space wasters.</p>
                      <p><strong>Storage Needs:</strong> Inventory everything you need to store. NYC apartments rarely have enough closets. Custom storage solutions (built-ins, under-bed drawers, wall-mounted systems) are essential.</p>
                      <p><strong>Ceiling Height:</strong> Standard NYC ceilings are 8 feet, but pre-war buildings often have 9-10 foot ceilings. Higher ceilings allow for taller furniture, dramatic lighting, and vertical storage.</p>
                    </div>
                  </div>
                  <Tip>Measure your rooms in the morning, afternoon, and evening to understand how light changes. Take photos at each time. The difference between a north-facing and south-facing room determines everything from paint sheen to fabric durability.</Tip>

                  <p>
                    Color is the most powerful (and most affordable) design tool you have. In NYC apartments, where rooms are often small and light is limited, the right color choices can make spaces feel dramatically larger, brighter, and more sophisticated.
                  </p>
                  <p><strong>Key principles for NYC apartments:</strong></p>
                  <ul className="ml-6 space-y-2 list-disc">
                    <li><strong>Light colors expand space:</strong> Whites, creams, and light neutrals make small rooms feel larger. This does not mean everything must be white — warm whites and greiges are more inviting than stark white.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dark colors add drama:</strong> Deep navies, forest greens, and charcoals create intimacy and sophistication. Use them in rooms with good light or as accent walls.</li>
                    <li><strong>Warm vs. cool undertones:</strong> North-facing rooms benefit from warm tones (yellow-based whites, warm grays). South-facing rooms can handle cooler tones (blue-based whites, cool grays).</li>
                    <li><strong>Flow between rooms:</strong> In open-plan apartments, use a cohesive palette that flows room to room. Vary the intensity (lighter in main areas, deeper in bedrooms) rather than changing the color family.</li>
                    <li><strong>The 60-30-10 rule:</strong> 60% dominant color (walls, large furniture), 30% secondary color (upholstery, rugs), 10% accent color (pillows, art, accessories). This creates balance without monotony.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <Tip>Test paint colors with large samples (at least 12x12 inches) on multiple walls in the room. Paint looks different on every wall because of how light hits it. Check your samples in morning light, afternoon light, and evening lamplight before deciding.</Tip>

                  <p>
                    Lighting is the most underrated element of interior design. Good lighting makes everything in a room look better — your furniture, your art, your finishes, and even you. Bad lighting makes even beautiful spaces feel flat, harsh, or depressing.
                  </p>
                  <p><strong>The three layers of lighting:</strong></p>
                  <ul className="ml-6 space-y-2 list-disc">
                    <li><strong>Ambient (general):</strong> Overhead fixtures, recessed lights, flush mounts. Provides overall illumination. Use dimmers on everything — non-negotiable in good design.</li>
                    <li><strong>Task:</strong> Under-cabinet lights, desk lamps, reading lights. Provides focused light where you need it for specific activities.</li>
                    <li><strong>Accent:</strong> Picture lights, uplights, decorative sconces. Highlights art, architecture, and creates atmosphere. This is what separates designed spaces from regular rooms.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    In NYC apartments, where ceiling heights are often limited and many units lack overhead light fixtures in living rooms (a common pre-war issue), creative lighting solutions are essential. Table lamps, floor lamps, and plug-in wall sconces can transform a room without any electrical work.
                  </p>
                  <Tip>Use 2700K (warm white) bulbs throughout your home for a cohesive, warm glow. Avoid mixing color temperatures — 3000K in the kitchen and 2700K in the living room creates a jarring difference when rooms are visible to each other. Dimmers are the single best investment in any lighting plan.</Tip>

                  <Tip>Always include a 15-20% contingency in your budget. NYC renovations consistently uncover surprises behind walls — old plumbing, outdated wiring, asbestos, structural issues. Without contingency, these discoveries blow your budget and stall your project.</Tip>

                      { mistake: "Ignoring scale and proportion", detail: "Oversized furniture in a small room makes it feel cramped. Undersized furniture makes it feel like a waiting room. Every piece should be proportional to the room and to other pieces." },
                      { mistake: "Treating each room independently", detail: "Your apartment should feel like a cohesive home, not a series of unrelated rooms. Carry common colors, materials, or design elements throughout." },
                      { mistake: "Skipping the lighting plan", detail: "A single overhead fixture is not a lighting plan. Layer ambient, task, and accent lighting. Add dimmers to everything. Bad lighting ruins even the most beautiful design." },
                      { mistake: "Underestimating storage needs", detail: "NYC apartments have notoriously little storage. Custom closets, built-in shelving, and multi-functional furniture should be part of every design plan." },
                      { mistake: "Not accounting for building logistics", detail: "Material delivery, contractor access, noise restrictions, and board approvals all take time. Building logistics add 20-40% to project timelines in NYC." },

                  <ul className="ml-6 space-y-2 list-disc">
                    <li><strong>Portfolio alignment:</strong> Their previous work should resonate with your style. If you love modern minimalism, do not hire a designer whose portfolio is all traditional.</li>
                    <li><strong>NYC experience:</strong> NYC design requires specific knowledge of building codes, co-op processes, contractor networks, and delivery logistics. Experience matters here more than in any other market.</li>
                    <li><strong>Clear fee structure:</strong> Understand exactly how they charge — hourly, flat fee, percentage, or cost-plus. Get it in writing before work begins.</li>
                    <li><strong>Project management capability:</strong> A designer who can manage contractors, vendors, and timelines saves you enormous stress and often money.</li>
                    <li><strong>Communication style:</strong> You will work closely with this person for months. Make sure your communication styles are compatible and they are responsive.</li>
                    <li><strong>References:</strong> Talk to at least 2-3 previous clients. Ask about budget adherence, timeline management, and how problems were handled.</li>
