const designFaqs = [
  { question: "Do I need an interior designer or can I do it myself?", answer: "Small updates like paint colors, accessories, and furniture rearrangement are great DIY projects. However, for renovations involving layout changes, custom cabinetry, material selection across multiple rooms, or any work requiring permits, a professional designer saves you time, money, and costly mistakes. NYC-specific challenges like co-op board requirements and building logistics make professional help especially valuable." },
  { question: "How much does it cost to hire an interior designer in NYC?", answer: "Interior designers typically charge $150-$350/hour, a flat fee per room ($2,000-$15,000), or a percentage of the total project budget (15-25%). Many designers offer a free initial consultation. For a full apartment redesign, expect to invest $15,000-$75,000+ in design fees depending on scope and complexity." },
  { question: "How long does an interior design project take?", answer: "A single room refresh takes 4-8 weeks. A full apartment redesign takes 3-6 months. A gut renovation takes 6-18 months. Lead times for custom furniture (8-16 weeks) and contractor scheduling are the biggest factors. NYC co-op board approval alone can add 1-3 months to the timeline." },
  { question: "What is the difference between an interior designer and an interior decorator?", answer: "Interior designers handle space planning, construction documents, material specifications, and project management — they can reconfigure layouts, specify custom millwork, and coordinate with architects and contractors. Interior decorators focus on the decorative elements: furniture, color, accessories, and styling. For NYC renovations, you want a designer." },
  { question: "How do I prepare for an interior design consultation?", answer: "Gather inspiration images (Pinterest boards, magazine clippings), know your budget range, list your must-haves and nice-to-haves, understand your timeline, and be honest about how you actually live. Designers need to know your daily routines, storage needs, entertaining habits, and any specific requirements (home office, pet areas, children's needs)." },
  { question: "What are the best interior design styles for NYC apartments?", answer: "Popular NYC styles include: modern/contemporary (clean lines, minimal clutter), transitional (blend of traditional and modern), mid-century modern (vintage-inspired with warmth), industrial (exposed elements, raw materials), and classic pre-war (preserving architectural details). The best style is one that reflects your personality while working with your apartment's architecture." },
