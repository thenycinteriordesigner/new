            It Started With a 400-Square-Foot Studio
          </h2>

          <div className="space-y-6 text-slate-700 text-lg leading-relaxed">
            <p>
              When you live in a 400-square-foot studio in the East Village and you&rsquo;re
              determined to make it feel like a real home — not just a box with a bed — you
              learn to design out of necessity. Every inch matters. Every piece of furniture
              needs to earn its place. That&rsquo;s where this started — not in a design school
              lecture hall, but in a tiny apartment where the dining table was also the desk,
              the bookshelf was also the room divider, and the closet was a creative engineering
              project.
            </p>

            <p>
              Friends started asking for help. Then their friends. Then their friends&rsquo; landlords.
              Before long, what started as solving spatial puzzles for fun became a real business —
              one client, one apartment, one brownstone at a time. Every project taught us something
              new about what makes NYC living work: how light moves between buildings, why a 30-inch
              sofa matters more than a 32-inch one, and how to convince a co-op board that yes, this
              renovation will actually improve the building.
            </p>

              From Studios to Penthouses
            </h3>

            <p>
              As our portfolio grew, so did the scale of our projects. Studio apartments became
              one-bedrooms. One-bedrooms became brownstone full-floor renovations. Brownstones
              became luxury penthouses. Along the way, we built a team of specialists — certified
              kitchen and bath designers, lighting experts, renovation managers, procurement
              coordinators — each one with deep NYC experience and an obsessive attention to detail.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 font-heading mt-12 mb-4">
              The Commercial Breakthrough
            </h3>

            <p>
              Then came the project that changed the trajectory of the firm. A restaurant owner
              in SoHo hired us to design a 3,000-square-foot space — our first major commercial
              project. We handled everything: the floor plan, the custom banquettes, the bar
              design, the lighting scheme, the acoustic treatment. The space was featured in
              design publications and suddenly we were fielding calls from office tenants, retail
              brands, and hospitality groups across Manhattan and Brooklyn.

              Designing NYC — One Space at a Time
            </h3>

            <p>
              Today, {SITE_NAME} designs residential and commercial interiors across all five
              boroughs, Long Island, Westchester, and New Jersey. We&rsquo;ve completed over
              2,500 projects — from studio apartments in Astoria to townhouse gut-renovations
              in Park Slope, corner offices in Midtown to boutique hotels in the Lower East Side.
              Every project is different because every client is different. And that&rsquo;s what
              makes this work exciting.
            </p>

            <p>
              We didn&rsquo;t come to interior design from fashion or art school. We came to it
              from living in New York City — from the daily reality of making tight spaces work,
              navigating building politics, and creating homes that are as functional as they are
              beautiful. That&rsquo;s what separates us from decorators. We design for real NYC life.
