const pricingFaqs = [
  {
    question: "How do interior designers in NYC charge for their services?",
    answer: "NYC interior designers typically use one of three fee structures: (1) Flat fee per project or per room — you pay a set design fee covering concept through specification. (2) Hourly rate — typically $150-$400/hour depending on the designer's experience. (3) Cost-plus — the designer charges retail prices on all furnishings and takes a percentage markup (usually 20-35%). We use a flat-fee structure because it is the most transparent and predictable for clients.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is NOT included in interior design fees?",
    answer: "Design fees cover the creative and management work — concepts, drawings, specifications, sourcing, and project management. They do NOT typically include the cost of furniture, materials, fixtures, contractor labor, permits, or delivery/installation fees. These costs are separate and itemized so you know exactly where your money goes. We provide detailed budgets upfront so there are no surprises.",
  },
  {
    question: "How much should I budget for furniture in an NYC apartment?",
    answer: "A general rule of thumb: budget $15,000-$30,000 for a well-furnished one-bedroom apartment, $30,000-$60,000 for a two-bedroom, and $50,000-$150,000+ for a three-bedroom or larger. These ranges cover quality, long-lasting furniture from mid-to-high-end sources. Custom and luxury furnishings will increase these numbers significantly.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is hiring an interior designer worth the cost in NYC?",
    answer: "Yes, for several reasons: (1) Designers prevent expensive mistakes — buying the wrong sofa, choosing the wrong paint color, or selecting materials that don't work together. (2) Trade-only access means better pricing on furniture and materials. (3) Professional project management saves time and reduces renovation stress. (4) Well-designed interiors increase property value — studies show professionally designed homes sell faster and for 5-15% more than comparable undesigned properties.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I hire a designer on a limited budget?",
    answer: "Absolutely. Our consultation packages start at $500 and provide professional guidance you can execute yourself. Single-room designs start at $5,000. We also offer phased design plans where we design the entire home but implement it over time — one room per quarter, for example. This spreads the investment while maintaining a cohesive overall design.",
  },
  {
    question: "How much does a kitchen renovation cost in NYC?",
    answer: "NYC kitchen renovation costs include design fees ($8,000-$35,000) plus construction costs. A cosmetic refresh runs $15,000-$30,000. A mid-range gut renovation costs $40,000-$75,000. A high-end luxury kitchen renovation can exceed $100,000-$200,000+. These figures include cabinetry, countertops, appliances, flooring, lighting, plumbing, and electrical work.",
